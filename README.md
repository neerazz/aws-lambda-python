# aws-lambda-python
Creating a CI/CD pipeline for an AWS Lambda function involves several steps and components. Let's break down the process and then I'll provide you with a sample Python project structure and a shell script for deployment through Jenkins.

### Project Structure

Your Python project can be structured as follows:

```
my-lambda-project/
│
├── lambda_function.py  # Main Lambda handler
├── db_connector.py     # Module for connecting to the database
├── kafka_producer.py   # Module for interacting with Kafka
├── requirements.txt    # List of dependencies
└── deploy.sh           # Shell script for deployment
```

### Sample Python Files

1. `lambda_function.py`: This is the entry point for the Lambda function.
2. `db_connector.py`: Handles the database connection and queries.
3. `kafka_producer.py`: Sends messages to a Kafka topic.

### CI/CD Strategy

1. **Source Control**: Use a Git repository to manage your source code. GitHub, Bitbucket, or AWS CodeCommit can be used.

2. **Build Phase**: Whenever there's a merge to the master branch, Jenkins triggers a build. Jenkins will execute the `deploy.sh` script.

3. **Testing**: Implement unit tests that can be run automatically during the build process.

4. **Deployment**: Use AWS CLI commands to deploy the Lambda function.

### Sample `deploy.sh` Script

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Define variables
S3_BUCKET="your-s3-bucket-name"
LAMBDA_FUNCTION_NAME="your-lambda-function-name"
ZIP_FILE="lambda.zip"

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt -t ./

# Bundle files into a zip
zip -r $ZIP_FILE ./*

# Upload to S3
aws s3 cp $ZIP_FILE s3://$S3_BUCKET/$ZIP_FILE

# Update Lambda function
aws lambda update-function-code --function-name $LAMBDA_FUNCTION_NAME --s3-bucket $S3_BUCKET --s3-key $ZIP_FILE
```

### Steps to Execute

1. Ensure AWS CLI is installed and configured with the necessary IAM permissions in your Jenkins environment.

2. Add `deploy.sh` to your repository and ensure it's executable (`chmod +x deploy.sh`).

3. Configure Jenkins to trigger the `deploy.sh` script on a merge to the master branch.

### Sample Python Project

I'll provide you with a basic structure for the Python files. Let's start with that.

#### `lambda_function.py`

```python
import db_connector
from app import kafka_producer


def lambda_handler(event, context):
    # Connect to database
    db_details = db_connector.get_database_details()

    # Send message to Kafka
    kafka_producer.send_to_kafka(db_details)

    return {
        'statusCode': 200,
        'body': 'Process completed successfully'
    }
```

#### `db_connector.py`

```python
def get_database_details():
    # Logic to connect to database and fetch details
    return "Database Details"
```

#### `kafka_producer.py`

```python
def send_to_kafka(message):
    # Logic to send message to Kafka
    pass
```

#### `requirements.txt`

```
# Add your dependencies here, for example:
boto3
kafka-python
```

This setup provides a basic CI/CD framework. You'll need to adapt the Python code to fit your specific requirements, such as database and Kafka connection details. Additionally, ensure your Jenkins environment is set up with the necessary permissions and AWS credentials.
